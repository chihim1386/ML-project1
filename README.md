#California Housing Prices ML Project
About the Dataset
The California Housing dataset is featured in the second chapter of Aurélien Géron's book, Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow. This dataset serves as an excellent introduction to machine learning algorithms, as it requires basic data cleaning, offers a straightforward list of variables, and is appropriately sized—neither too simplistic nor overly complex. The data originates from the 1990 California census, making it less relevant for current housing price predictions compared to datasets like Zillow's Zestimate, but it remains a valuable resource for teaching the fundamentals of machine learning.
Content
The dataset includes information about houses in various California districts, along with summary statistics derived from the 1990 census. Users should note that the dataset is not pre-cleaned, necessitating some preprocessing steps. The columns in the dataset include:
longitude: Longitude of the district
latitude: Latitude of the district
housing_median_age: Median age of houses in the district
total_rooms: Total number of rooms in the district
total_bedrooms: Total number of bedrooms in the district
population: Population of the district
households: Number of households in the district
median_income: Median income in the district
median_house_value: Median house value (the target variable)
ocean_proximity: Proximity to the ocean (categorical variable)
